Working from user stories was relatively easy as they had mainly simple and precise requirements.

Having the test cases before development made it slightly easier as it somewhat segments the development by creating clear incremental goals. However, the given test cases were lacking in depth and accuracy e.g. test ID 5 states both the case is valid and it should be treated as not. There were many potential cases not covered by the set of tests given.

I used generative AI right at the end of the project to aid in the visuals of the program, using it to get the website looking as close to the wireframe as possible. I use it simple to give information and example code and never to copy paste from.

Generative AI has many potential flaws, it can lack context and have outdated information as it is trained on internet data. Additionally, if code has been copy pasted or similar it is unlikely to be understood which causes huge issues when it comes to debugging/upgrading the system.

To implement the project I coded the user requirements in a HTML file.

I have learnt a huge amount about HTML, CSS and Javascript as i had basically no experience before this mini-project.

I would do a huge amount differently if I were to do this again. I would entirely rework how the validation and colour worked to allow for early exits from the functions. I would use an external Javascript file if I knew how to along with an external CSS. I would also rework my working order as the visuals of the program ar almost entirely separate from the funtionality I could have worked on them in parrallel with the funtionality.
